# Dissertation-EPHR
This project aims to develop a privacy-aware medical informatics system using access control models like Discretionary (DAC), Role-Based (RBAC), Mandatory (MAC), and Attribute-Based (ABAC). The system must efficiently handle unforeseen scenarios, including Break-the-Glass (BtG), without compromising EPHR data security.
